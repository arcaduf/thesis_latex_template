I would like to express here my gratitude to the many people that have characterized this long and beautiful journey. 
\newline\newline
I thank Prof. Marco Stampanoni for granting me the opportunity to conduct this doctoral project
at TOMCAT, for his trust starting from the beginning and for having always been supportive to this work even in its darkest moments.
\newline\newline
I thank my supervisor Dr. Federica Marone, from whom I learnt the importance of a practical spirit in steering the research
and being constructively critic. Thanks for the countless hours that you spent behind my manuscripts, reports, presentations or posters
and for even working at night, in the weekends or on holidays just to give me feedbacks and crucial remarks as soon as possible.
I owe you for sure my scientific writing.
\newline\newline
I thank Alain Studer for the incredible help when I started to approach scientific computing in Python. I will be always grateful
for the many long and insightful discussions on inverse problems and signal processing, that we had at Time-out. I was lucky to find
someone so passionate for his job and so capable of thinking outside the box.
\newline\newline
I thank Dr. Goran Lovric and Dr. Silvia Peter for having been such good friends and having shared with me the happy and less happy moments
since the start. Thanks to Goran for two unforgettable trips to Graz and Vodice and
for all the advices, when I had barely a clue of how many things work. Thanks to Silvia for sharing with me tons of experiences like 
the wonderful concerts of Einsturzende and Massive Attack, our trip to Milan and Berlin. We ended this journey almost together and I wish
you luck with all the will come.
\newline\newline
I thank my dear friend Fabio D'Isidoro, who is probably one of the most sincere and unique person I have ever met so far.  
\newline\newline
I thank my dear friend Dr. Alberto Astolfo, that always reminded to take life from the bright side and not to take myself too seriously.
Man, you don't know it yet, but you have been my personal Socratis, somehow.
\newline\newline
I thank Dr. Rajmund Mokso for all the good time we had at conferences and workshops and to enjoy the convivial aspect of these scientific
meetings.
\newline\newline
I thank Dr. Pablo Villanueva for the insightful discussions on physics and image reconstruction, it was a pleasure to work with you and I hope
will have other occasions to do.
\newline\newline
I thank Dr. Jakob Vogel, that I ``annoyed'' with questions and discussion right after he sat at his new desk in our group. Many thanks for having
revised this thesis and to be so meticolous in your work, I really enjoyed collaborating with you.
\newline\newline
I thank Ioannis Vogiatzis for being always so prone to help in any moment. Good luck with your PhD journey!
\newline\newline
I thank Matteo Abis, Dr. Peter Modregger, Dr. Kevin Mader, Carolina Arboleda, Maria B\"{u}chner, Mathias Kagias, Dr. Zhentian Wang, Dr. Spyridon Gkoumas, 
Dr. Alekhin Mikhail, Dr. Alessandra Patera and Dr. Anne Bonin
for having been such good and funny colleagues. Doing almost three hours per day of commuting to come to PSI was not so bad after all, thinking
that I would have shared the day with you. I hope to find in the future a team that can resemble you guys, good luck to you as well!
\newline\newline
My deepest gratitude, however, goes to you, Olivera, for having been at my side during this journey and for being such a good ``scientific collaborator'' in this
project called life.
