abstract = {Microtomography (micro-computed-tomography, {\$}\mu{\$}-CT) is a method to image and quantify trabecular bone. It has the capability to address the role of trabecular architecture on the mechanical properties of bone and to study trabecular bone remodeling. The system described in this work is based on a compact fan-beam type tomograph that can work in spiral scanning or multislice mode. An X-ray tube with a microfocus is used as a source, a CCD-array as a detector. Samples with diameters from a few millimeters to a maximum of 14 mm can be measured, typically, bone biopsies with a diameter of 8 mm and a length of approximately 10 mm are measured. Spatial resolution is 28 {\$}\mu{\$}m. Usually the volume of interest contains 4{\{}$\backslash$texttimes{\}}4{\{}$\backslash$texttimes{\}}4 mm3 and is represented in 14{\{}$\backslash$texttimes{\}}14{\{}$\backslash$texttimes{\}}14 {\$}\mu{\$}m3 voxels. 3D stereological indices are extracted according to the standard definitions used in histomorphometry. Triangular surface representation is effected with an extended marching cube algorithm and forms a convenient basis for finite element analysis. Microtomographic measurements may be employed to ``calibrate'' lower-dose, lower-resolution imagesin vivo as well as to nondestructively assess unprocessed surgical bone biopsy specimens. These specimens remain intact for mechanical or histological testing.},

@article{Westneat2003,
abstract = {Insects are known to exchange respiratory gases in their system of tracheal tubes by using either diffusion or changes in internal pressure that are produced through body motion or hemolymph circulation. However, the inability to see inside living insects has limited our understanding of their respiration mechanisms. We used a synchrotron beam to obtain x-ray videos of living, breathing insects. Beetles, crickets, and ants exhibited rapid cycles of tracheal compression and expansion in the head and thorax. Body movements and hemolymph circulation cannot account for these cycles; therefore, our observations demonstrate a previously unknown mechanism of respiration in insects analogous to the inflation and deflation of vertebrate lungs.},

abstract = {Particularly high coherence of the x-ray beam is associated, on the ID19 beamline at ESRF, with the small angular size of the source as seen from a point of the sample (0.1-1 µrad). This feature makes the imaging of phase objects extremely simple, by using a `propagation' technique. The physical principle involved is Fresnel diffraction. Phase imaging is being simultaneously developed as a technique and used as a tool to investigate light natural or artificial materials introducing phase variations across the transmitted x-ray beam. They include polymers, wood, crystals, alloys, composites or ceramics, exhibiting inclusions, holes, cracks, ... . `Tomographic' three-dimensional reconstruction can be performed with a filtered back-projection algorithm either on the images processed as in attenuation tomography, or on the phase maps retrieved from the images with a reconstruction procedure similar to that used for electron microscopy. The combination of diffraction (`topography') and Fresnel (`phase') imaging leads to new results.},

abstract = {In developing embryos of some extant spiralian animals, polar lobe formation is one of the symmetry-breaking mechanisms for segregation of maternal cytoplasmic substances to certain blastomeres and not others. Polar lobe formation leads to unique early cleavage morphologies that include trilobed, J-shaped, and five-lobed structures. Fossil embryos similar to modern lobeforming embryos are recognized from the Precambrian Doushantuo Formation phosphates, Weng{\{}$\backslash$textquoteright{\}}an, Guizhou Province, China. These embryos are abundant and form a developmental sequence comparable to different developing stages observed in lobe-forming embryos of extant spiralians. These data imply that lobe formation is an evolutionarily ancient process of embryonic specification.},

  abstract={First Talbot interferometry in the hard X-ray region was demonstrated using a pair of transmission gratings made by forming gold stripes on glass plates. By aligning the gratings on the optical axis of X-rays with a separation that caused the Talbot effect by the first grating, moiré fringes were produced inclining one grating slightly against the other around the optical axis. A phase object placed in front of the first grating was detected by moiré-fringe bending. Using the technique of phase-shifting interferometry, the differential phase corresponding to the phase object could also be measured. This result suggests that X-ray Talbot interferometry is a novel and simple method for phase-sensitive X-ray radiography.}

  abstract={The X-ray phase tomography of biological samples is reported, which is based on X-ray Talbot interferometry. Its imaging principle is described in detail, and imaging results obtained for a cancerous rabbit liver and a mouse tail with synchrotron radiation are presented. Because an amplitude grating is needed to construct an X-ray Talbot interferometer, a high-aspect-ratio grating pattern was fabricated by X-ray lithography and gold electroplating. X-ray Talbot interferometry has an advantage that it functions with polychromatic cone-beam X-rays. Finally, the compatibility with a compact X-ray source is discussed.}

abstract = {Inverse problems that require the solution of integral equations are inherent in a number of indirect imaging applications, such as computerized tomography. Numerical solutions based on discretization of the mathematical model of the imaging process, or on discretization of analytic formulas for iterative inversion of the integral equations, require a discrete representation of an underlying continuous image. This paper describes discrete image representations, in n-dimensional space, that are constructed by the superposition of shifted copies of a rotationally symmetric basis function. The basis function is constructed using a generalization of the Kaiser--Bessel window function of digital signal processing. The generalization of the window function involves going from one dimension to a rotationally symmetric function in n dimensions and going from the zero-order modified Bessel function of the standard window to a function involving the modified Bessel function of order m. Three methods are given for the construction, in n-dimensional space, of basis functions having a specified (finite) number of continuous derivatives, and formulas are derived for the Fourier transform, the x-ray transform, the gradient, and the Laplacian of these basis functions. Properties of the new image representations using these basis functions are discussed, primarily in the context of two-dimensional and three-dimensional image reconstruction from line-integral data by iterative inversion of the x-ray transform. Potential applications to three-dimensional image display are also mentioned.},

In order to reduce the specimen's exposure time, we propose a new iterative algorithm that can achieve the same quality as FBP-type methods, while using substantially fewer angular views. Our approach is based on 1) a novel spline-based discretization of the forward model and 2) an iterative reconstruction algorithm using the alternating direction method of multipliers. Our experimental results on real data suggest that the method allows to reduce the number of required views by at least a factor of four.},

  abstract={The ordered subsets EM (OSEM) algorithm has enjoyed considerable interest for emission image reconstruction due to its acceleration of the original EM algorithm and ease of programming. The transmission EM reconstruction algorithm converges very slowly and is not used in practice. In this paper, we introduce a simultaneous update algorithm called separable paraboloidal surrogates (SPS) that converges much faster than the transmission EM algorithm. Furthermore, unlike the `convex algorithm' for transmission tomography, the proposed algorithm is monotonic even with nonzero background counts. We demonstrate that the ordered subsets principle can also be applied to the new SPS algorithm for transmission tomography to accelerate `convergence', albeit with similar sacrifice of global convergence properties as for OSEM. We implemented and evaluated this ordered subsets transmission (OSTR) algorithm. The results indicate that the OSTR algorithm speeds up the increase in the objective function by roughly the number of subsets in the early iterates when compared to the ordinary SPS algorithm. We compute mean square errors and segmentation errors for different methods and show that OSTR is superior to OSEM applied to the logarithm of the transmission data. However, penalized-likelihood reconstructions yield the best quality images among all other methods tested.}

  abstract={A data sufficiency condition for 2D or 3D region-of-interest (ROI) reconstruction from a limited family of line integrals has recently been introduced using the relation between the backprojection of a derivative of the data and the Hilbert transform of the image along certain segments of lines covering the ROI. This paper generalizes this sufficiency condition by showing that unique and stable reconstruction can be achieved from an even more restricted family of data sets, or, conversely, that even larger ROIs can be reconstructed from a given data set. The condition is derived by analysing the inversion of the truncated Hilbert transform, here defined as the problem of recovering a function of one real variable from the knowledge of its Hilbert transform along a segment which only partially covers the support of the function but has at least one end point outside that support. A proof of uniqueness and a stability estimate are given for this problem. Numerical simulations of a 2D thorax phantom are presented to illustrate the new data sufficiency condition and the good stability of the ROI reconstruction in the presence of noise.}

  abstract={A data sufficiency condition for 2D or 3D region-of-interest (ROI) reconstruction from a limited family of line integrals has recently been introduced using the relation between the backprojection of a derivative of the data and the Hilbert transform of the image along certain segments of lines covering the ROI. This paper generalizes this sufficiency condition by showing that unique and stable reconstruction can be achieved from an even more restricted family of data sets, or, conversely, that even larger ROIs can be reconstructed from a given data set. The condition is derived by analysing the inversion of the truncated Hilbert transform, here defined as the problem of recovering a function of one real variable from the knowledge of its Hilbert transform along a segment which only partially covers the support of the function but has at least one end point outside that support. A proof of uniqueness and a stability estimate are given for this problem. Numerical simulations of a 2D thorax phantom are presented to illustrate the new data sufficiency condition and the good stability of the ROI reconstruction in the presence of noise.}

Phys. 32 673, Defrise et al 2006 Inverse Problems [/0266-5611/22/3/019] 22 1037 ), this paper shows that the solution to the interior problem in computed tomography is unique if a tiny a priori knowledge on the object f ( x , y ) is available in the form that f ( x , y ) is known on a small region located inside the region of interest. Furthermore, we advance the uniqueness result to obtain more general uniqueness results which can be applied to a wider class of imaging configurations. We also develop a reconstruction algorithm which can be considered an extension of the DBP-POCS (projection onto convex sets) method described by Defrise et al ( 2006 Inverse Problems [/0266-5611/22/3/019] 22 1037 ), where we not only extend this method to the interior problem but also introduce a new POCS algorithm to reduce computational cost. Finally, we present experimental results which show evidence that the inversion corresponding to each obtained uniqueness result is stable.}

  abstract={A case of incomplete tomographic data for a compactly supported attenuation function is studied. When the attenuation function is a priori known in a subregion, we show that a reduced set of measurements are enough to uniquely determine the attenuation function over all the space. Furthermore, we found stability estimates showing that reconstruction can be stable near the region where the attenuation is known. These estimates also suggest that reconstruction stability collapses quickly when approaching the set of points that is viewed under less than 180°. This paper may be seen as a continuation of the work 'Truncated Hilbert transform and image reconstruction from limited tomographic data' (Defrise et al 2006 Inverse Problems [/0266-5611/22/3/019] 22 1037 ). This continuation tackles new cases of incomplete data that could be of interest in applications of computed tomography.}

  abstract={A new algorithm for the reconstruction of two-dimensional (2D) images from projections is described. The algorithm is based on the decomposition of the projections into Chebyshev polynomials of the second kind, which are the ideal basis functions for this application. The Chebyshev decomposition is done via the fast discrete sine transform. A discrete reconstruction filter is applied that corresponds to the ramp filter used in standard filtered backprojection (FBP) reconstruction. In contrast to FBP, the filter is applied to the Chebyshev coefficients and not to the Fourier coefficients of the projections. Then the reconstructed image is simply obtained by means of backprojection. Consequently, the method can be considered as a Chebyshev-domain filtered backprojection (CD-FBP). The total calculation time is dominated by the backprojection step only and is comparable to FBP. The merits of CD-FBP as compared with standard FBP are that: (a) The result is exact if the 2D function to be reconstructed can be decomposed into polynomials of finite degree, and if the sampling is adequate. Otherwise a polynomial approximation results. (b) The algorithm is inherently discrete. (c) It is particularly well suited for reconstructions from projections with non-equidistant samples that occur for instance in 2D PET (positron emission tomography) imaging and in a special form of fan beam scanning. Examples of applications comprise reconstructions of the Shepp and Logan head phantom in various sampling geometries, and a real PET test object. In the PET example an increased resolution is observed in comparison with standard FBP.}

abstract = {X ray radiography and tomography are important tools in medicine as well as in life science and materials science. Not long ago an approach called in-line holography based on simple propagation became possible using partially coherent synchrotron beams like the ones available at the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility (ESRF). Theoretical and experimental work by Cloetens Appl. Phys. Lett 75, 2912 (1999) have shown that quantitative retrieval of the optical phase, from a set of radiographs taken at different sample-to-detector distances, is feasible. Mathematically speaking we are dealing with a direct method based on linearization in order to solve an inverse nonlinear problem. The phase retrieval can be combined with classical tomography in order to obtain a three-dimensional representation of the object's electron density (holotomography). In order to optimize the image contrast for the numerical phase retrieval process, we have carried out calculations resulting in an optimized choice of value and number of the sample-to-detector distances as well as of the photon energy. These results were then confirmed by experiments on the ESRF long beamline ID19. (c) 2005 American Institute of Physics.},

@article{Mayo2002,
abstract = {We outline a new approach to X-ray projection microscopy in a scanning electron microscope (SEM), which exploits phase contrast to boost the quality and information content of images. These developments have been made possible by the combination of a high-brightness field-emission gun (FEG)-based SEM, direct detection CCD technology and new phase retrieval algorithms. Using this approach we have been able to obtain spatial resolution of {\textless} 0.2 {\&}mu;m and have demonstrated novel features such as: (i) phase-contrast enhanced visibility of high spatial frequency image features (e.g. edges and boundaries) over a wide energy range; (ii) energy-resolved imaging to simultaneously produce multiple quasi-monochromatic images using broad-band polychromatic illumination; (iii) easy implementation of microtomography; (iv) rapid and robust phase/amplitude-retrieval algorithms to enable new real-time and quantitative modes of microscopic imaging. These algorithms can also be applied successfully to recover object-plane information from intermediate-field images, unlocking the potentially greater contrast and resolution of the intermediate-field regime. Widespread applications are envisaged for fields such as materials science, biological and biomedical research and microelectronics device inspection. Some illustrative examples are presented. The quantitative methods described here are also very relevant to projection microscopy using other sources of radiation, such as visible light and electrons.},

abstract = {A structural understanding of whole cells in three dimensions at high spatial resolution remains a significant challenge and, in the case of X-rays, has been limited by radiation damage. By alleviating this limitation, cryogenic coherent diffractive imaging (cryo-CDI) can in principle be used to bridge the important resolution gap between optical and electron microscopy in bio-imaging. Here, the first experimental demonstration of cryo-CDI for quantitative three-dimensional imaging of whole frozen-hydrated cells using 8keV X-rays is reported. As a proof of principle, a tilt series of 72 diffraction patterns was collected from a frozen-hydrated {\it Neospora caninum} cell and the three-dimensional mass density of the cell was reconstructed and quantified based on its natural contrast. This three-dimensional reconstruction reveals the surface and internal morphology of the cell, including its complex polarized sub-cellular structure. It is believed that this work represents an experimental milestone towards routine quantitative three-dimensional imaging of whole cells in their natural state with spatial resolutions in the tens of nanometres.},

abstract = {We demonstrate absolute quantitative mass density mapping in three dimensions of frozen-hydrated biological matter with an isotropic resolution of 180 nm. As model for a biological system we use Chlamydomonas cells in buffer solution confined in a microcapillary. We use ptychographic X-ray computed tomography to image the entire specimen, including the 18 $\mu$m-diameter capillary, thereby providing directly an absolute mass density measurement of biological matter with an uncertainty of about 6{\%}. The resulting maps have sufficient contrast to distinguish cells from the surrounding ice and several organelles of different densities inside the cells. Organelles are identified by comparison with a stained, resin-embedded specimen, which can be compared with established transmission electron microscopy results. For some identified organelles, the knowledge of their elemental composition reduces the uncertainty of their mass density measurement down to 1{\%} with values consistent with previous measurements of dry weight concentrations in thin cellular sections by scanning transmission electron microscopy. With prospects of improving the spatial resolution in the near future, we expect that the capability of non-destructive three-dimensional mapping of mass density in biological samples close to their native state becomes a valuable method for measuring the packing of organic matter on the nanoscale.},

abstract = {We have used the method of x-ray diffraction microscopy to image the complex-valued exit wave of an intact and unstained yeast cell. The images of the freeze-dried cell, obtained by using 750-eV x-rays from different angular orientations, portray several of the cell's major internal components to 30-nm resolution. The good agreement among the independently recovered structures demonstrates the accuracy of the imaging technique. To obtain the best possible reconstructions, we have implemented procedures for handling noisy and incomplete diffraction data, and we propose a method for determining the reconstructed resolution. This work represents a previously uncharacterized application of x-ray diffraction microscopy to a specimen of this complexity and provides confidence in the feasibility of the ultimate goal of imaging biological specimens at 10-nm resolution in three dimensions.},

abstract = {Phase-contrast x-ray imaging (PCI) is an innovative method that is sensitive to the refraction of the x-rays in matter. PCI is particularly adapted to visualize weakly absorbing details like those often encountered in biology and medicine. In past years, PCI has become one of the most used imaging methods in laboratory and preclinical studies: its unique characteristics allow high contrast 3D visualization of thick and complex samples even at high spatial resolution. Applications have covered a wide range of pathologies and organs, and are more and more often performed in vivo. Several techniques are now available to exploit and visualize the phase-contrast: propagation- and analyzer-based, crystal and grating interferometry and non-interferometric methods like the coded aperture. In this review, covering the last five years, we will give an overview of the main theoretical and experimental developments and of the important steps performed towards the clinical implementation of PCI.},

This criterion, based on how efficiently these techniques detect the scattered photons and validated through simulations, shows in general that projection microscopy can resolve smaller phase differences and features than coherent diffraction imaging. Our criterion can be used to design optimized imaging experiments and perform feasibility studies for sensitive biological materials in free-electron lasers, where the number of photons per pulse is limited, or in synchrotron experiments, for both techniques.},

@article{Howells2009,
abstract = {X-ray diffraction microscopy (XDM) is a new form of x-ray imaging that is being practiced at several third-generation synchrotron-radiation x-ray facilities. Nine years have elapsed since the technique was first introduced and it has made rapid progress in demonstrating high-resolution three-dimensional imaging and promises few-nm resolution with much larger samples than can be imaged in the transmission electron microscope. Both life- and materials-science applications of XDM are intended, and it is expected that the principal limitation to resolution will be radiation damage for life science and the coherent power of available x-ray sources for material science. In this paper we address the question of the role of radiation damage. We use a statistical analysis based on the so-called "dose fractionation theorem" of Hegerl and Hoppe to calculate the dose needed to make an image of a single life-science sample by XDM with a given resolution. We find that for simply-shaped objects the needed dose scales with the inverse fourth power of the resolution and present experimental evidence to support this finding. To determine the maximum tolerable dose we have assembled a number of data taken from the literature plus some measurements of our own which cover ranges of resolution that are not well covered otherwise. The conclusion of this study is that, based on the natural contrast between protein and water and "Rose-criterion" image quality, one should be able to image a frozen-hydrated biological sample using XDM at a resolution of about 10 nm.},

abstract = "Abstract The recent mathematical concept of compressed sensing (CS) asserts that a small number of well-chosen measurements can suffice to reconstruct signals that are amenable to sparse or compressible representation. In addition to powerful theoretical results, the principles of \{CS\} are being exploited increasingly across a range of experiments to yield substantial performance gains relative to conventional approaches. In this work we describe the application of \{CS\} to electron tomography (ET) reconstruction and demonstrate the efficacy of CS–ET with several example studies. Artefacts present in conventional \{ET\} reconstructions such as streaking, blurring of object boundaries and elongation are markedly reduced, and robust reconstruction is shown to be possible from far fewer projections than are normally used. The CS–ET approach enables more reliable quantitative analysis of the reconstructions as well as novel 3D studies from extremely limited data. "
